In recent years, there has been growing interest by various engineering product companies to perform design simulation studies at different stages of product development to compete in the market. This has consistently resulted in increased requirement of skilled CFD resources and proving to be a very good career opportunity for engineers aspiring to make a career in the interesting domain of heat transfer and fluid flows. However there seems to be a widespread confusion in the student community as to what skills are desired by these industries for a fresher to qualify.

As per the definition *“Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the science of predicting fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer, chemical reactions, and related phenomena by solving the mathematical equations that govern these processes using numerical methods (i.e., on a computer)”. The scope of applications of CFD thus seem to be wide in the engineering disciplines of aeronautical/ aerospace, automobile, mechanical, chemical involving primarily flow and thermal analysis studies*.

Fluid (gas and liquid) flows are governed by Partial Differential Equations which represent conservation laws for the mass, momentum, and energy. CFD is the art of reducing such complex PDE systems to a set of linear equations which can be solved using computers. Navier-Stokes equation, which describes the motion of fluids, has been described as “one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics” [Navier Stokes Existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness) and is, till date, beyond human analysis. CFD primarily attempts to get the best solvable approximation to the N-S equation using various mathematical algorithms, enabling us to understand the motion of fluids.

### The Necessity of CFD
Consider a project to design a new aircraft with specified mission requirements. The design of any product is an iterative process. Imagine the impracticality of testing different versions of a life-sized preliminary design: a wind tunnel large enough to fit the aircraft, a fan powerful enough to simulate the actual flow, the amount of work to be put in to change the design to the minutest detail every single time and so on. An alternative is to test a scaled prototype, but the loss of data or the disregard of the change in various parameters affected by the change in size can lead to a catastrophe. Using CFD analysis, we import a 3D model of the design and simulate the actual conditions under which the aircraft is supposed to perform. We get aerodynamic and structural results and use them to modify (which is just to change the CAD model!) the design.

### Why CFD is preferred?
1. Cost-effective & Time-consuming — Assume that you are testing a new design of refrigerator. You are trying to determine the flow rate, phase change, and change of temperature in the refrigerant. Now, if you try to build a test model and perform experiments, it will be time consuming and expensive. Also, if the model fails to pass some test, you will have to rectify your mistake, build another model, etc. which is really a long process. But in CFD software, you can perform numerous experiments once you have designed the model. If you happen to have many designs, you can build them on the computer, run tests and zero down the right model for production. — all while saving time and money.

2. Can investigate the flow of liquids in challenging conditions — In some cases, when we work with dangerous liquids or liquid metals, it is impossible to investigate their flow behavior without compromising our safety to some extent. Or if you are working with complex systems where the temperature or pressure is too high, you will not be able to insert a probe into the system to analyze it. In such cases, CFD comes in extremely handy.

3. Provides detailed insight into flow behavior — when testing an opaque component, you cannot analyze the flow inside the component visually. In CFD, you can take picture of the flow inside the component and extract the necessary information from it. This is vital because inflow mechanics, visualized data is essential.

CFD is hard to do well and easy to do badly. Expertise is gained by running many cases and checking the quality of those cases religiously. **Below are a few tips on improving your CFD knowledge and analysis skills**.

1. Gain in-depth knowledge of Partial Differential Equations and Numerical Analysis. This can be achieved by referring to books, but the best way to get acquainted with the same and the basics of CFD would be through an online course.

2. Get hands-on experience. Once the basics are sort out, the best way to get acquainted with the usage, understanding and analysis of CFD would be to get hands-on experience on CFD. Probably a course or a training where the institution provides good software for you to work on and experience a few real world problems would be the right way to go.

3. Once you receive the knowledge of working on CFD, you should run validation cases regularly and prove to yourself that you are making good choices. Run numerical tests with varying aspects of the case set up and compare them to the validation cases. Learn what becomes a big mistake and what has little or no effect.

4. Learn many tools and know what each does well and what each does badly. Don’t ever hesitate to try a new tool or re-evaluate an older tool (that’s been improved by the developer). Network with other CFD people and developers and find out what others know.

CFD is very big globally, being extensively used in various fields such as Automobile, Aerospace, Bio-Medical, Civil, Marine, Sports etc. Almost anything new by a big player in these fields would have CFD applications. But, in India, CFD is still in infantry stage, as it has not been included in the undergraduate level academia. CFD today is an add-on course, like say Java was, a decade ago. There are students who attend these courses and get acquainted with CFD. Today, there are a lot of analysis projects that are getting outsourced to India. So, India is definitely catching up on the industry front in CFD.
