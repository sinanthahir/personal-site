The more time you take in writing, the more you experience. If you’re an amateur, starting to write — go for your trajectory of life. Many people think they need to do something massive or be famous to write about their life, That’s not truth at all. The reason behind writing about your life is that you have a real story; *something worth changing lives of others* with your trial and tribulations.

Even you aren’t ready for a memoir, thou still have a valuable piece of short influential timeline, experiences or the knowledge gained that can help others; can be pen downed. It’s hard to peek inside, one of the hardest things in our life is to look inside ourselves. The harder you self-reflect, the more you discover who you been these all time. It can be objected a time when we evaluate ourselves.

Not to mention writing a memoir.

The most important thing to write a book about yourself is to get really, **really honest** and dig into the raw and deep parts about yourself. Nobody wants a book about you that’s all sunshine and rainbows because that’s not real life.
