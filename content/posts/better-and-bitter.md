> Criticism means the expression of disagreement of someone or something that is based on perceived beliefs, faults and mistakes.

Now the point is to consider whether it’s good or not. Taking criticism can be a difficult thing. Nobody likes to be told that something they have slaved over for days didn’t quite hit the mark. If we go by it’s meaning; to criticize someone is bad and even if you know some of your work probably deserved some extra love, criticism always stings.

But on the other hand, it may lead to improvement of the person being criticized and he becoming a better person, not repeating the mistakes again. At some point, even my writings — are so dependant on reviews and opinions. Though one day you will encounter a customer or your audience and even a reviewer — who wants to tell you how to do things better. But it’s not all bad news because sometimes you can use criticism to give you a competitive edge. It entirely depends upon the perceived value hidden behind the criticism.

## Criticism : a form of communication.

If someone has a criticism for you; literally take it as they want to give you a feedback on what you are done or doing for them. We all make mistakes all the time, it is human nature. As we go through life we have plenty of opportunity to learn and improve ourselves. That means Criticism is an opportunity to learn more about the person who you’re working for and in case your a influencer or in business; how to convert them into a satisfied customer or audience member.

> “Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving.” — [Dale Carnegie](https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en)

Generally speaking, there may be some truth behind each criticism you get; even it is given out on spite and bitterness. The criticism aimed at you may not make sense at the time, It is often the case that a slight change on your character is a fair reflection of how another person sees you at that point in time. So take a step-back, try to look from other’s perspective or ask the opinions of a honest friend, that will make you.

## Criticism : gives you a Competitive advantage.

You cannot be sure whatever the critic is saying is right. Having heard him out, compare his statements or assessments with the facts on the ground. Sort out what is true from what is a biased statement and make objective analysis of them.

Think about it : if you are a Salesperson and can get a customer to tell you — and just you — how to give them the perfect product or service, that’s information you’ve got that no one else has. Even being a criticism too, the information you gets, puts you at an advantage over anyone else in your sector and can be used again in the future to get things right, even faster.

If you are open to suggestions around how you might approach things differently, you’ll be perceived as a more authentic leader and it’ll be easier for you to rally a team around a common goal or towards improving shared processes.

## Think Before Act.

Don’t take it personally if someone doesn’t immediately like your work. Not everyone has pure motives when it comes to giving you feedback. If the criticism you’re receiving really stings, think about what that person is saying. *Are they talking about something that directly influences the way you work or your behavior in a specific situation? Or are they more concerned about you come off as a person?* The key thing to remember is that whatever the circumstance is, don´t respond in anger as this will cause a scene and create bad feelings — and possibly a bad image of you.

>**Remember**: *when people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong. — [Neil Gaiman](https://www.neilgaiman.com/)*.

There will be occasions when you feel the criticism is personal and, now and then, you’ll be right.If feedback is based on something intrinsic to your personality, it’s not important enough to worry about. Criticism needs to be partnered with a solution to help you correct the action. If it’s not, the person is not interested in helping enough to warrant getting involved, literally it’s enough for them to shut up.They are also able to make it work to their advantage or, if all else fails, politely conclude the partnership and leave with their reputation intact.

Unsure of how effectively you’re communicating? Try to transform your critical phrases into feedback that inspires change. May these words help you along !
