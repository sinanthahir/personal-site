# Hi, I'm Sinan Thahir

A passionate, cross-functional, and result-driven professional with over two years of BI analysis experience across market research, metrics insights, strategy, documentation, and self-learning methodologies to create data-dependent product development.

My high energy and passion for fun come with me in my day-to-day life. I take pride in doing a little bit of everything. In addition to my career, I’ve had the opportunity to be a speaker for the IEDC at Rajadhani Institute, Where I came to fresh perspectives and new things from colleagues and junior ones. I also keep busy inputting statistics for Welkin Aves as well as startups at ICC, and Rajadhani Institute. It’s definitely not uncommon to see me working two jobs on the same day. Sometimes it can be difficult to juggle, but I always find it rewarding.
